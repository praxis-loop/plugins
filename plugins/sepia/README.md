> De-AI writing at the layer that actually gives AI away. Fiction gets its narrative architecture repaired before anyone touches word choice; professional documents (release notes, PR replies, postmortems, tickets, technical articles) each get rules matched to their venue.

A portable [Agent Skill](https://agentskills.io/specification): any agent that speaks the standard can load it, and the [Skills CLI](https://skills.sh), which supports 77+ agents, installs it with one command. Claude Code, Codex, Grok Build, Antigravity, and QwenPaw additionally get native plugin packaging. One canonical `SKILL.md`, no per-platform forks. Four operations: **write**, **review** (diagnose only), **refactor** (minimal edits), **recreate** (full rewrite).

## Why another humanizer

Every popular humanizer edits word choice and syntax. [StoryScope](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.03136) (Russell et al., 2026: 61,608 stories, human + 5 frontier LLMs) showed that a classifier using **narrative-structure features alone** detects AI fiction at 93.2% macro-F1. In the same study's LAMP-edited condition, where human editors had rewritten the surface style, detection dropped only from 95.5% to 93.9%. The tells that survive are architectural: themes explained by the narrator, single-track causally-tidy plots, emotions rendered only as bodily sensation, no real-world references, no reader, linear time, endings resolved by protagonist growth and acceptance.

sepia turns those measured gaps, together with the related studies digested in [`research/`](research/), into a three-pass writing and revision protocol for fiction:

| Pass | Layer | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Narrative architecture (fiction) | stop explaining the theme, loosen the causal chain, back-load revelations, mix emotion modes, sparse character networks, name real things |
| 2 | Discourse flow | de-template the paragraph-question sequence, fix the mid-story sag, vary rhythm and positions |
| 3 | Surface style | the classic layer: clichés, syntax templates, vocabulary, register |

A 30-feature diagnosis rubric and per-model fingerprints across two layers apply when the writing or executing model is known:

| Model family | Narrative layer (StoryScope) | Sentence-level prose layer (Vendor prompting guides) |
|---|---|---|
| Claude | Measured | Claude Fable 5.1 and Mythos 5.1, Fable 5 and Mythos 5, Opus 5, Opus 4.8 |
| GPT | Measured | GPT-5.6, GPT-6 Astra |
| Gemini | Measured | Gemini 3 series |
| DeepSeek | Measured | Consulted (no guidance published) |
| Kimi | Measured | Consulted (no guidance published) |

> **Notice:** Vendors that publish no prompt guidance are recorded as consulted, not guessed.

Professional prose fails differently, and the structure-level finding holds there too: a 2026 replication of StoryScope on 2,250 company blog posts against 11,250 AI mirrors separated them at 98.0 macro-F1 from structural features alone, with the AI shape described as tidy and self-announcing (`SLOPSHAPE-2026` in the ledger, arXiv:2609.15369; a preprint whose features are LLM-scored; it tested detection of original and model-self-reworded posts, never human editing). The studies digested in [`research/`](research/) point at filler that carries no information, hedging where a judgment was needed, chatbot leftovers, register that ignores the venue, and formatting that looks stamped out. Each document type gets a thin rule file on top of one shared checklist:

| Domain | The gist |
|---|---|
| Release notes / announcements | user impact first, artifacts per claim, no marketing inflation |
| PR / issue replies | answer first, cite `file:line`, no reflex praise, length ∝ stakes |
| Postmortems | blameless toward people, merciless toward mechanisms; timestamps, dead ends, owned action items |
| Tickets / work orders | title = outcome, testable acceptance criteria, link don't repeat |
| Technical articles | open at the problem, one real dead end, one committed opinion, numbers with conditions |
| Long-form journalism (features, investigations, data stories) | lead and body in two registers, quotations keep their spoken texture, every number carries a comparison, no summary ending |

> **Governing principle:** Calibrate to the human distribution, don't invert the AI one. Humans sit at moderate values; a story with every rule applied is a new fingerprint. The skill selects 3–5 moves per story and leaves slack.

## Operation entries

The complete plugin package gives Claude Code, Codex, Grok Build, and Antigravity a general router plus five direct entries. QwenPaw gets the `/sepia` router only, so the table below does not apply there:

| Operation | Claude Code | Codex | Grok Build | Antigravity | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| write | `/sepia-write` | `$sepia-write` | `/sepia-write` | `/sepia-write` | Create new prose |
| review | `/sepia-review` | `$sepia-review` | `/sepia-review` | `/sepia-review` | Diagnose without editing |
| refactor | `/sepia-refactor` | `$sepia-refactor` | `/sepia-refactor` | `/sepia-refactor` | Make minimal in-place edits |
| recreate | `/sepia-recreate` | `$sepia-recreate` | `/sepia-recreate` | `/sepia-recreate` | Rewrite from the source facts and intent |
| hemingway | `/sepia-hemingway` | `$sepia-hemingway` | `/sepia-hemingway` | `/sepia-hemingway` | Write or refactor fiction with the built-in Hemingway voice applied |

The general `/sepia` (Claude Code, Grok Build, Antigravity, and QwenPaw) or `$sepia` (Codex) router remains available; on QwenPaw the package installs the six skills into each workspace and registers no per-operation slash commands. What was verified on each platform is stated under [Install](#install).

> **Notice:** Standalone wrapper installation is unsupported. The operation wrappers depend on their sibling canonical skill; install the complete plugin package.

## Experimental: composing with voice skills

Since v0.4.0, sepia defines an interface for stacking a voice or style skill on top of it — a minimalism method, a brand voice, a persona guide. It is opt-in: tell sepia the voice skill is in play, and it loads `references/voice-skills.md` over the normal route. No external voice is loaded unless you say so.

The interface contract operates under fixed precedence rules across operations and routes:

| Rule dimension | Contract specification |
|---|---|
| Architecture | sepia's architecture decisions come first. |
| Move selection | Voice moves are applied selectively (3–5 signature moves per piece, fewer when a sparse shape or the facts offer fewer; formula endings deliberately broken sometimes). |
| Review diagnostics | Review reports the voice's known costs instead of fixing them away. |
| Uniformity enforcement | Uniformity findings keep full strength: a voice does not excuse a metronome. |
| Professional register | On professional routes, the venue still sets the register. |
| Conflict resolution | Direct conflicts come back to you. |

> **Notice:** The voice-skills interface is grounded in one blind review experiment on a strict-minimalism specimen — a worked example, not measured evidence.

Two built-in profiles ship under `references/voices/`, alongside a persona profile kind with declared override rights:

| Profile | Target routes | Source & characteristics | Opt-in & invocation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hemingway (`references/voices/hemingway.md`) | Fiction and professional prose | Iceberg omission for fiction, the Kansas City Star rules for professional prose; each move traced to its source | Direct entry `/sepia-hemingway` (or `$sepia-hemingway`). On fiction, asking for strong de-AI on a story counts as opting in (sepia announces the profile and how to decline). Without an opt-in, a fiction review only reports when the text fits the profile and loads nothing. |
| Taiwan long-form journalism (`references/voices/tw-journalism.md`) | Professional routes only | Nine narrative shapes with their moves, drawn from private human-side journalism measurement and its close reading | Opt-in phrase: `"apply the Taiwan journalism voice"`. Follows the same rules as Hemingway. |
| Persona template (`references/voices/PERSONA-TEMPLATE.md`) | Author-defined | One writer's style with declared override rights; checked by `scripts/check_persona.py` | Author-created profile. Template at `references/voices/PERSONA-TEMPLATE.md`. |
| Nyaneko (`references/voices/personas/nyaneko.md`) | Professional routes only | Built-in companion voice written from the maintainer's voice specification with her own exemplars | Opt-in phrase: `"apply persona Nyaneko"` or `「套用 persona Nyaneko」`. |

### Writing with a persona: a short how-to

sepia's rules remove tells. Warmth has another source: the writer knowing who is speaking, and to whom. One case from this project's own release, with nothing measured: the v0.12.0 Threads post was drafted twice by the same model from the same release notes. The first prompt handed it a skeleton (version line, bullets, fixes, engineering note, update line) and got a form filled in. The second prompt handed it an identity, "I maintain this project and just shipped v0.12.0; talk to my followers in my own voice; how you organise it is yours", plus the notes as the only fact source and the platform's limits, and got the post the maintainer kept. A sepia review of that post then found its tells clustered at the opening and the close (an opening about how the change came to be, a maxim ending, a few absolutes), and a refactor took them out without touching the middle.

The order that worked:

1. Identity first.
2. Facts separately, as the only source.
3. Constraints stated as platform limits, with the structure left to the model.
4. sepia as the check.

```text
Do not use tools; everything you need is below.
I am <who>, writing for <whom>, about <what just happened>. Use my own voice; how to organise it is yours.
Platform limits: <length, markup, mentions>.
Facts come only from the notes below; numbers and identifiers must match them.
===== notes =====
<the source document>
```

A persona profile is that identity written down once so every piece starts from it: what they are to the reader, what their first sentence does, how warmth attaches to a fact, what they never do, and pieces in their own voice as exemplars. The template is `references/voices/PERSONA-TEMPLATE.md`, the built-in `references/voices/personas/nyaneko.md` is a worked example, and the interface validator checks the profile structure:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_persona.py <file>
```

Write your own; the exemplars carry more than the description does.

## Sentence rhythm and Chinese calibration

The style pass checks the *spread* of sentence lengths, the one syntactic measure on which every study that measured it agrees: human text varies more within a passage, in English and in Chinese.

| Syntactic measure | Status | Empirical basis |
|---|---|---|
| Sentence length spread | Checked signal | Within-passage variance is consistently higher in human text across English and Chinese studies. Evidence and numbers are in [`research/rhythm-syntax.md`](research/rhythm-syntax.md). |
| Mean sentence length | Discarded | Measured directions contradict each other across corpora. |
| Punctuation counts | Discarded | Measured directions contradict each other across corpora. |
| Paragraph length | Discarded | Measured directions contradict each other across corpora. |

Chinese text loads `references/languages/zh.md`, calibrating the style pass across four distinct evidence layers:

| Layer / Source | Nature of evidence | Corpus & calibration details |
|---|---|---|
| HC3 (2023) | Measured corpus | Human-vs-machine Chinese corpus baseline. |
| Traditional Chinese journalism | Human-side empirical measurement | About two thousand articles from one unnamed Taiwanese publication spanning about ten years (corpus not distributed; digest in [`research/zh-news-corpus.md`](research/zh-news-corpus.md)). |
| Contrast group | Machine-side empirical contrast | 119 synthetic pieces across three models using one shared base prompt with a one-line variant for one model. |
| Taiwan conventions | Normative standard | Short normative section of Taiwan writing conventions drawn from public standards and first-tier consensus. |

> **Notice:** The limits of all three empirical Chinese sources are stated in `references/languages/zh.md`.

## Install

> **Notice:** Every command below is written for **user scope** — install once, use it in every project.

### Any agent (Skills CLI, 77+ agents)

```bash
npx skills add Nanako0129/sepia -g     # -g = user scope; the default is project
npx skills update sepia -g             # update
npx skills remove sepia -g             # uninstall
```

Installs on every agent the [Skills CLI](https://skills.sh) supports — Cursor, Cline, Windsurf, Copilot, OpenCode, goose, and more. Pick your agents when prompted. Runtime behavior outside the five platforms below has not been exercised by us; the skill is plain markdown under the Agent Skills standard, so file an issue if your agent trips on it.

> **Notice:** "Verified" means the install completes and the sepia entries appear. The five native plugin installers were each exercised with a live install (QwenPaw's by its contributor). Whether the entries then behave as documented has not been checked platform by platform.

### Claude Code

```bash
# install
claude plugin marketplace add Nanako0129/sepia
claude plugin install sepia@sepia --scope user

# update
claude plugin marketplace update sepia
claude plugin update sepia
```

> **Tip:** The in-session `/plugin install` dialog asks you to pick a scope — choose **User** there.

### Codex

```bash
# install
codex plugin marketplace add Nanako0129/sepia
codex plugin add sepia@sepia

# update — refresh the marketplace snapshot, then re-add to pick up the new version
codex plugin marketplace upgrade sepia
codex plugin add sepia@sepia
```

### Grok Build

```bash
# install
grok plugin install Nanako0129/sepia --trust

# update
grok plugin update
```

Grok also auto-discovers a Claude Code install of sepia if you have one; either route works.

### Antigravity

```bash
# install directly from GitHub
agy plugin install https://github.com/Nanako0129/sepia
```

### QwenPaw

```bash
# install: qwenpaw takes a local directory (or a zip URL), so clone first;
# the package's skills symlink resolves inside the clone
git clone https://github.com/Nanako0129/sepia
qwenpaw plugin install ./sepia/.qwenpaw-plugin

# uninstall
qwenpaw plugin uninstall sepia
```

> **Notice:** Contributor-verified on QwenPaw 2.2.1 (#250, not reproduced by the maintainer): the install completes and `/sepia` is routed, with the packaged `skills` symlink followed into a real tree by `shutil.copytree`.

### Project scope (alternative)

When one repo should pin its own copy, commit `skills/sepia/` into that repo as `.agents/skills/sepia` (Codex + Antigravity) or `.claude/skills/sepia` (Claude Code).

## Uninstall

Each tool uses its native command:

```bash
# Claude Code
claude plugin uninstall sepia@sepia --scope user

# Codex
codex plugin remove sepia@sepia

# Grok Build
grok plugin uninstall sepia

# Antigravity
agy plugin uninstall sepia

# QwenPaw
qwenpaw plugin uninstall sepia
```

## Support

You can use sepia for free without an account. The research behind every rule is open. Ongoing costs are just maintainer time and two kinds of model quota: delegating literature surveys to research agents that read primary papers, and running live models to test rule changes on A/B stories and cross-platform end-to-end reviews before shipping. You can support the project on Patreon.
