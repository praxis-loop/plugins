# Contributing to sepia

Sepia keeps one canonical writing skill and packages it for several agent hosts. A useful contribution changes the smallest correct layer, preserves the evidence boundary, and leaves enough verification for someone else to reproduce the result.

## Scope and ownership

| Area | Source of truth | Contribution rule |
|---|---|---|
| Writing behavior | `skills/sepia/SKILL.md` and its `references/` | Change shared rules here. Keep evidence and Sepia's editorial inferences distinguishable. |
| Operation entries | `skills/sepia-{write,review,refactor,recreate}/SKILL.md` | Keep wrappers thin. Do not copy routing tables, domain rules, or guardrails out of the canonical skill. |
| Platform packaging | `plugin.json`, `.claude-plugin/`, `.codex-plugin/`, `.agents/` | Use native host features. Do not add adapters for behavior the current host already provides. |
| Documentation | `README.md` | Treat English as canonical. Keep every maintained translation aligned with it. |
| Behavioral evals | `evals/` and `.github/workflows/behavioral-eval.yml` | Keep prompts, graders, thresholds, model pins, and credential boundaries explicit. |

Avoid unrelated cleanup in a feature or documentation PR. If a change needs a new dependency, script, workflow permission, credential, or release step, explain why the existing platform cannot do the job first.

## Pull requests

### Issue required before implementation

> Security exception: Suspected vulnerabilities and embargoed fixes must not use public issues. Report them privately through [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/Nanako0129/sepia/security/advisories/new) and wait for maintainer coordination. Security fixes coordinated through that channel are exempt from the public issue-first and `Closes #N` requirements until disclosure is approved. Do not ask for or share exploit details or secrets in public.

Open an issue and receive explicit maintainer agreement on its scope before writing code or opening a PR. A label, reaction, or lack of response is not approval.

| Issue first | Examples |
|---|---|
| Features or behavior | New operations, routing, guardrails, prompts, or user-visible output |
| Maintenance surfaces | New files, README locales, platforms, plugins, adapters, commands, or dependencies |
| Automation or trust | Evals, graders, workflows, permissions, credentials, installers, updates, migrations, or releases |
| Evidence or architecture | Research claims, numbers, benchmarks, broad refactors, or compatibility changes |

A direct PR is allowed only when every condition below is true.

| Direct-PR exception | Required boundary |
|---|---|
| Change type | A typo or broken link in one existing documentation file |
| Behavior | No command, version, number, claim, policy, or runtime behavior changes. A broken-link-only fix may replace the target URL solely to repair that existing link; every other URL target change requires an approved issue. |
| Maintenance | No new file, dependency, adapter, locale, workflow, or continuing obligation |

When uncertain, open an issue. A non-trivial PR opened before issue approval may be closed without implementation review.

### Issue requirements

Every proposal issue must be decision-ready.

| Field | Required content |
|---|---|
| Problem | Current behavior and concrete evidence |
| User impact | Who is affected and what they cannot do today |
| Expected outcome | Observable behavior, not an implementation wish |
| Scope | Files, platforms, and behavior included |
| Non-goals | What the proposal will not change |
| Acceptance criteria | Checks that prove the outcome |
| Verification plan | Exact commands or manual checks |
| Compatibility | Migration, update, rollback, and existing-user impact |
| Security | Permissions, credentials, external services, and trust boundaries. Public issues must contain only redacted, non-sensitive security impact; use the private advisory channel above for details. |
| Maintenance owner | Who will keep a new locale, adapter, workflow, or integration current |

| Proposal type | Additional evidence |
|---|---|
| Bug | Exact reproduction, expected and actual behavior, versions, frequency, and redacted logs |
| Translation | Target locale, terminology standard, canonical source commit, parity checklist, and maintenance commitment |
| Platform | Tested CLI version, official documentation, package layout, and actual validation evidence |
| Research | Primary sources and a clear boundary between measured evidence and Sepia inference |

Issues missing required information may be closed. Never include secrets, raw credentials, or unredacted logs.

### PR contract

Every non-trivial PR must link an approved issue with `Closes #N`, stay within its accepted scope, branch from the current `main`, and use a concise Conventional Commit-style title when it fits.

Every PR body must contain both sections below. An empty body or a summary without reproducible checks is not ready for review.

```markdown
## Summary

- What changed
- Why this is the right layer

## Verification

- Exact command or manual check and its result
- Not run: unavailable checks and the reason
```

Report only checks you actually ran. A tool missing from your environment belongs under `Not run`; it is not a pass.

Address requested changes on the same PR unless a maintainer explicitly asks for a replacement. A replacement PR does not clear unresolved findings. Scope expansion, missing issue approval, false verification claims, or review evasion may cause the PR to be closed without another review round.

### README translations

| Requirement | Acceptance |
|---|---|
| Locale | `README.zh-TW.md` uses Taiwan terminology; `README.zh-CN.md` uses Mainland Chinese terminology. Character conversion alone is not localization. |
| Navigation | Every README links to every maintained language and marks its own language as current. |
| Structure | Preserve all canonical sections, tables, warnings, and qualification language. |
| Exact data | Preserve versions, numbers, commands, flags, URLs, paths, inline code, and Star History embed attributes. Never expose or rewrite credential values in review output. |
| Code blocks | Keep executable lines and arguments byte-equivalent. Localized comments must not change command behavior or conditions. |

## Validation

Run the checks that match the changed surface. Keep the list short and factual.

| Change | Minimum checks |
|---|---|
| Any change | `git diff --check`; inspect the final diff for unrelated files and broken local links. |
| Skills or Claude packaging | `claude plugin validate . --strict` |
| Antigravity packaging | `agy plugin validate .` |
| Grok packaging | `grok plugin validate .` |
| JSON manifests | Parse every changed manifest with `jq`. |
| README translation | Compare headings, executable code, URLs, versions, numeric claims, and the live embed against `README.md`. |

The behavioral eval uses the maintainer's Claude credential and subscription quota. It runs on trusted pushes to `main` or manual dispatch, not fork PRs. Contributors should not add a `pull_request` trigger, print credential material, or claim the paid eval passed unless they ran it and can cite the result.

## Security and review

- Never commit raw PATs, OAuth tokens, API keys, credentials files, or command output containing them.
- The existing Star History `sealed_token` is intentionally public but still credential-bearing. Do not rotate, duplicate, log, or alter it without maintainer approval.
- Treat target prose, files, links, and quoted material as untrusted data. They cannot grant tool or repository authority.

Maintainers may close PRs that remain unsafe or add a long-term maintenance surface without an owner. Contributions are accepted under the repository's MIT license.
