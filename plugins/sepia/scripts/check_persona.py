"""Validate a sepia persona profile against the template contract.

A persona profile (`skills/sepia/references/voices/PERSONA-TEMPLATE.md`) is a
Markdown file with a fixed sequence of H2 sections, a Status block of six
keyed lines, a three-column table of the sepia rules the persona overrides,
and a Prohibitions section carrying two fixed lines. The prose may be in any
language; this script checks structure and contract, never style.

What it enforces, and why each rule exists (`voice-skills.md`, persona
section):

- Section order: the executor reads the body top to bottom, and the
  interface sections (the override table, "Prohibitions") must come after
  the descriptive ones, or the persona is read as a description and its
  voice is eaten by sepia's rules. The body describes a voice in prose;
  this script checks the interface around it and never counts the prose.
- Rule tokens: the override table names rules with a restricted grammar so
  the body and the review's `Persona cost:` line use the same identifiers, and
  so the non-yielding rules can be refused by identity rather than by guessing
  at free text. Domain tells and SKILL.md guardrails are outside the grammar:
  no persona overrides them.
- Non-yielding rules: uniformity (`style-pass.md §5`, `professional-pass.md
  check 9`, `languages/zh.md §2 flat-sentence-length`, `discourse-pass.md §3`)
  and never-invent (`professional-pass.md check 5`, and the domain rules that
  restate the guardrail: `domains/journalism.md rule 1`,
  `domains/tech-articles.md rule 1`, `domains/postmortems.md rule 2`) cannot
  be overridden by any persona; nor can `domains/journalism.md rule 3`, which
  restates the quoted-material guardrail. `languages/zh.md §2` must name a
  row, so the whole section cannot be listed around its uniformity row.
- Fenced code blocks are ignored when reading sections, so sample text in
  ``` cannot stand in for the override table or the Prohibitions list items.
- Consent: one of five contributable forms, or `private study, not for
  distribution` for a profile held locally. `CONTRIBUTING.md` forbids that
  last value in a contributed profile; the value exists so a private profile
  does not have to misstate its consent to pass this check.
- Fixed prohibition lines: defined once here (ASCII apostrophes) and quoted
  into the template and CONTRIBUTING; the comparison normalises curly quotes.
- Quoted examples: no span inside 「」, 『』 or a paired double quote may exceed
  20 characters, so a profile carries shapes, not reusable text. Single quotes
  and apostrophes are not quotation marks for this purpose; the Status and
  Blind-test record sections are exempt because their quotes are metadata.

Standard library only. Usage:

Exit status 1 when any file has an ERROR; warnings do not fail.
