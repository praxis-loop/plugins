"""Fail when the files that declare a version disagree about which one it is.

Three files carry sepia's version today: the Claude and Codex plugin manifests
and the canonical SKILL.md's frontmatter. They have never disagreed. This is a
guard for later, not a fix for now.

It matters because the failure would be silent. Nothing breaks at install time
when one manifest is a version behind; the wrong number just gets advertised,
and a version number is exactly the claim a reader uses to judge whether a
project is still maintained.

Two rules, covering the two ways this can rot:

1. Discovery. Any file named plugin.json or marketplace.json is read wherever
   it sits, for a top-level `version` and for one on each entry of a `plugins`
   array, and every SKILL.md's frontmatter is read for `metadata.version`. A
   manifest that gains a version later is checked from that moment. A `version`
   key that exists but is not a non-empty string fails: a field someone edited
   into a number or an empty value is a mistake, not an absence.

2. A required core. The three files that declare the version today must keep
   declaring it. Without this, deleting one of them would just shrink the
   agreeing set and the check would stay green, which is precisely the silent
   failure it exists to catch.

Files that declare nothing and are not required are listed, not failed: absent
is a legitimate state there, and printing them keeps the scan's reach visible.
Discovery finding nothing at all is likewise a failure, not a pass.

Standard library only, by design. The repository has no lockfiles and this
should not be the reason it gets one.

    python3 scripts/check_versions.py

Exit status is 0 when every declaration agrees and the required files all
declare, 1 otherwise. The unit tests live in tests/test_check_versions.py.
